# P-REx

This repository contains the Python module developped for the piston reconstruction experiment (P-REx).
P-REx reconstructs the piston drift due to the atmosphere above a single aperture in order to improve the senisitvity of optical interferometer. This module was develloped as part of my master thesis.

First details can be found in the paper by Pott et al (2016) and Widmann et al (2017, in preparation).

More information on the code in the Python files.
A complimentory repository contains my master thesis and an example notebook for the use of this module.
