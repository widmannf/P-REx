# P-REx

This repository contains the Python module developed for the piston reconstruction experiment (P-REx).
P-REx reconstructs the piston drift due to the atmosphere above a single aperture in order to improve the sensitivity of optical interferometer. This module was developed as part of my master thesis.

First details can be found in the paper by Pott et al (2016, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016SPIE.9907E..3EP) and Widmann et al (2017, in preparation).

More information on the code in the Python files.
A complimentary repository contains my master thesis and an example notebook for the use of this module.
